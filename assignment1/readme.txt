I. Uninformed Search
You will implement Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search and Iterative-Deepening Depth First Search. Use the pseudocode for the GraphSearch function and the Expand function in either the slides or the textbook to help you design the algorithm.

II. Informed Search
In this part, you will implement A-star search. As with uninformed search, there are specific requirements that you must follow:

When generating successors for a state, do it in the same order as for the Uninformed Search algorithms above.
Keep track of the number of nodes expanded in the same way as specified for the Uninformed Search above.
You will need a priority queue. You may use built-in code from your programming language (eg. Java) for the priority queue.
You will need a heuristic for A-star search. Pick one but make sure it is admissible.
You need to print the solution path which shows how to move from the start state to the goal state. Please print this to the screen and to an output file. Make sure it is in the right order!
